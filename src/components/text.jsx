	cabintext:<p>This is a mock-up website for my brother's company.
                     <br/><br/> Built using React, I tried to convey 
                    the overall ethos of the company with the website design.

                    <br/><br/>
                    Eventually, I will add a booking / payment system to the site.

	Networkers is a site I created from scratch to help me learn React.<br/>
                  <br/>It's almost like Tinder, except instead of swiping through dates
                  you swipe through workers in your area. <br/>
                  <br/>

                  So, if you need a pipe fixed or as website designed, <br/> you can swipe through the 
                  local plumbers or designers, and hire one you like!
