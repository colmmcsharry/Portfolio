	crezotext:<p>I made this site for a small construction company in Vancouver. 
                   <br/><br/> I replaced their old Wordpress site with a more modern
                   version using Gatsby.js.<br/> 
                   Loading times were vastly decreased and Lighthouse audit scores improved dramatically
                   in all areas.

                    <br/><br/>
                    The site is linked to Contentful CMS so they can manage the content themselves, without knowing any code.
                    <br/><br/> 
                    The colours, fonts and animations used were chosen to give a professional and modern look.

	cabintext:<p>This is a mock-up website for my brother's company.
                     <br/><br/> Built using React, I tried to convey 
                    the overall ethos of the company with the minimalist website design.

                    <br/><br/>
                    As this website is image-heavy, I learned a lot about optimising images and making them responsive.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The aesthetic is supposed to be "fun" and light-hearted, so I learned about using colours, fonts
                    and various CSS effects and animations to create the right look.
                    <br/><br/> 
                     When the company launches, I will add a booking / payment system to the site.

	Networkers is a site I created from scratch to help me learn React.<br/>
                  <br/>It's almost like Tinder, except instead of swiping through dates
                  you swipe through workers in your area. <br/>
                  <br/>

                  So, if you need a pipe fixed or as website designed, <br/> you can swipe through the 
                  local plumbers or designers, and hire one you like!

                  
                    <br/><br/> 
                    This was my first project built using React, and I really came to enjoy the component-based approach<br/>

  mystory: <p>
  Hello again and thanks for checking out my portfolio. Here I will describe my journey into the world of code and tell you a bit about myself.

So, from a very young age I enjoyed using computers and seeing what I could do with them. Mostly I just created “art” using Microsoft Paint, 
Microsoft Word and later, Photoshop and Windows Movie Maker. I have a big family (8 in total) and I was always the go-to guy whenever somebody needed help with the computer.

My family always encouraged me to get involved in tech. Unfortunately, in my secondary school days there was no IT subject on the curriculum. 
So, I ended up going to college and studying English, with a minor in Film Studies. 

Whilst I enjoyed my college days and got my degree, I still wasn’t sure what to do with myself after graduating. Over the next few years, 
I studied and worked in a variety of different areas which interested me. I studied Sports Performance and Personal Training, and worked as a PT/group fitness trainer for two years in Australia. 
On returning to Dublin, I worked for two years as an English language teacher.

Though these experiences weren’t really tech-related, they did gradually lead me towards studying computers in more depth. As a PT, I would use software to create programs, spreadsheets for tracking progress, 
marketing materials, etc. I wanted to create a long E-Book which I could provide for my clients as a reference.

As a teacher, I used lots of technology in the classroom and had an idea for a website/app that would help my students with the local Dublin lingo. 
I also wanted to make an online quiz game which students could play from their phones.

However, in trying to bring these ideas to life, I became frustrated with the limitations of the software I was using. 
At one point I wrote a 78 page fitness manual filled with images, charts, and videos purely in Microsoft Word (if you think positioning in CSS is frustrating, try that!).

I attempted to make the sites for my students on Wordpress and other site-builders, but I couldn’t get things exactly as I wanted them. As I googled more and more, it became apparent that people were teaching themselves how to code, so they could make their own apps and websites. 
Since I thought of myself as a techy sort of guy, I figured “if they can do it, why can’t I?”

This was in late 2017, and around this time (and probably based on my search history) ads started popping up on my Facebook feed for Coding Bootcamps. “12 weeks to a new career” they promised… 
Intrigued, I began to read and saw how people did seem to be getting jobs in this area, despite having no computer-science related degree. I attended an open day for one of them, and whilst they did a great job selling it, I wasn’t willing to pay the hefty tuition fee for something I felt that I could teach myself.

I first started dabbling in coding around Christmas time in 2017, when I had a bit of time off from my teaching job.
