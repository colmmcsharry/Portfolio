	crezotext:<p>I made this site for a small construction company in Vancouver. 
                   <br/><br/> I replaced their old Wordpress site with a more modern
                   version using Gatsby.js.<br/> 
                   Loading times were vastly decreased and Lighthouse audit scores improved dramatically
                   in all areas.

                    <br/><br/>
                    The site is linked to Contentful CMS so they can manage the content themselves, without knowing any code.
                    <br/><br/> 
                    The colours, fonts and animations used were chosen to give a professional and modern look.

	cabintext:<p>This is a mock-up website for my brother's company.
                     <br/><br/> Built using React, I tried to convey 
                    the overall ethos of the company with the minimalist website design.

                    <br/><br/>
                    As this website is image-heavy, I learned a lot about optimising images and making them responsive.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The aesthetic is supposed to be "fun" and light-hearted, so I learned about using colours, fonts
                    and various CSS effects and animations to create the right look.
                    <br/><br/> 
                     When the company launches, I will add a booking / payment system to the site.

	networktext:<p>

	Networkers is a site I created from scratch to help me learn React.<br/>
                  <br/>It's almost like Tinder, except instead of swiping through dates
                  you swipe through workers in your area. <br/>
                  <br/>

                  So, if you need a pipe fixed or as website designed, <br/> you can swipe through the 
                  local plumbers or designers, and hire one you like!

                  
                    <br/><br/> 
                    This was my first project built using React, and I really came to enjoy the component-based approach<br/>
