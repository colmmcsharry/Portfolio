                   <p>Loading times were vastly decreased and Lighthouse audit scores improved dramatically
                   in all areas.

                    <br/><br/>
                    The site is linked to Contentful CMS so they can manage the content themselves, without knowing any code.
                    <br/><br/> 
                    The colours, fonts and animations used were chosen to give a professional and modern look.

	cabintextlong:<p>This is a mock-up website for my brother's company.
                     <br/><br/> Built using React, I tried to convey 
                    the overall ethos of the company with the minimalist website design.

                    <br/><br/>
                    As this website is image-heavy, I learned a lot about optimising images and making them responsive.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The aesthetic is supposed to be "fun" and light-hearted, so I learned about using colours, fonts
                    and various CSS effects and animations to create the right look.
                    <br/><br/> 
                     When the company launches, I will add a booking / payment system to the site.
                     For more details, just
